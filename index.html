            <div id="panel">This website was created by Becky Greubel as part of the Spring 2021
                course Currents: A-Generative-Web, taught by John Provencher. By entering a word 
                above, poems based off of poetry written by Becky from 2004-2021 will be generated. <br><br>
                The poetry is created using RiTa.js and the Wordnik API, recreating lines using their 
                parts of speech, and finding synonyms and like words to your entry. The chapbook is then 
                presented using Bindery.js, and can be printed to have a physical chapbook of the poetry. <br><br>
